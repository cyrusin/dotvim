My vim
=======
    This is my vim configuration and plugins.

files
-----
    Copy the _vimrc to .vimrc, and mv it to your $HOME.

plugins
-------
    Less is more.
    Just use what you need.
    So start with not too many plugins.
About Command-T
---------------
    The version of command-t is important.
    Make sure you get the right version(32bit/64bit).
